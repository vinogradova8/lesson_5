			<p class="subtitle">The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is the
				only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish
				it from the wild members of the family.[4] A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat, or a feral cat; the
				latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and
				their ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.[6]</p>

			<div class="title">Etymology</div>
			<p>The origin of the English word cat, Old English catt, is thought to be the Late Latin word cattus, which was
				first used at the beginning of the 6th century.[21] It was suggested that the word 'cattus' is derived from
				an Egyptian precursor of Coptic ϣⲁⲩ šau, "tomcat", or its feminine form suffixed with -t.[22] The Late Latin
				word may be derived from another Afro-Asiatic[23] or Nilo-Saharan language. The Nubian word kaddîska
				"wildcat" and Nobiin kadīs are possible sources or cognates.[24] The Nubian word may be a loan from Arabic
				قَطّ‎ qaṭṭ ~ قِطّ qiṭṭ. It is "equally likely that the forms might derive from an ancient Germanic word,
				imported into Latin and thence to Greek and to Syriac and Arabic".[25] The word may be derived from Germanic
				and Northern European languages, and ultimately be borrowed from Uralic, cf. Northern Sami gáđfi, "female
				stoat", and Hungarian hölgy, "lady, female stoat"; from Proto-Uralic *käďwä, "female (of a furred
				animal)".[26]</p>
			<p>The English puss, extended as pussy and pussycat, is attested from the 16th century and may have been
				introduced from Dutch poes or from Low German puuskatte, related to Swedish kattepus, or Norwegian pus,
				pusekatt. Similar forms exist in Lithuanian puižė and Irish puisín or puiscín. The etymology of this word is
				unknown, but it may have simply arisen from a sound used to attract a cat.[27][28]</p>
			<p>A male cat is called a tom or tomcat[29] (or a gib,[30] if neutered). An unspayed female is called a
				queen,[31] (or a molly,[32] if spayed), especially in a cat-breeding context. A juvenile cat is referred to
				as a kitten. In Early Modern English, the word kitten was interchangeable with the now-obsolete word
				catling.[33] A group of cats can be referred to as a clowder or a glaring.[34]</p>

			<div class="characteristics title">Characteristics</div>
			<div class="size">
				<h3>Size</h3>
				<p>The domestic cat has a smaller skull and shorter bones than the European wildcat.[60] It averages about
					46 cm (18 in) in head-to-body length and 23–25 cm (9–10 in) in height, with about 30 cm (12 in) long
					tails. Males are larger than females.[61] Adult domestic cats typically weigh between 4 and 5 kg (9 and
					11 lb).[44]</p>
			</div>
			<div class="skeleton">
				<h3>Skeleton</h3>
				<p>Cats have seven cervical vertebrae (as do most mammals); 13 thoracic vertebrae (humans have 12); seven
					lumbar vertebrae (humans have five); three sacral vertebrae (as do most mammals, but humans have five);
					and a variable number of caudal vertebrae in the tail (humans have only three to five vestigial caudal
					vertebrae, fused into an internal coccyx).[62]: 11  The extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for
					the cat's spinal mobility and flexibility. Attached to the spine are 13 ribs, the shoulder, and the
					pelvis.[62]: 16  Unlike human arms, cat forelimbs are attached to the shoulder by free-floating clavicle
					bones which allow them to pass their body through any space into which they can fit their head.[63]</p>
			</div>
			<div class="skull">
				<h3>Skull</h3>
				<p>The cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a powerful specialized
					jaw.[64]: 35  Within the jaw, cats have teeth adapted for killing prey and tearing meat. When it
					overpowers its prey, a cat delivers a lethal neck bite with its two long canine teeth, inserting them
					between two of the prey's vertebrae and severing its spinal cord, causing irreversible paralysis and
					death.[65] Compared to other felines, domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth relative to the
					size of their jaw, which is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents, which have small
					vertebrae.[65] The premolar and first molar together compose the carnassial pair on each side of the
					mouth, which efficiently shears meat into small pieces, like a pair of scissors. These are vital in
					feeding, since cats' small molars cannot chew food effectively, and cats are largely incapable of
					mastication.[64]: 37  Although cats tend to have better teeth than most humans, with decay generally less
					likely because of a thicker protective layer of enamel, a less damaging saliva, less retention of food
					particles between teeth, and a diet mostly devoid of sugar, they are nonetheless subject to occasional
					tooth loss and infection.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="claws">
				<h3>Claws</h3>
				<p>Cats have protractible and retractable claws.[67] In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are
					sheathed with the skin and fur around the paw's toe pads. This keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear
					from contact with the ground and allows for the silent stalking of prey. The claws on the forefeet are
					typically sharper than those on the hindfeet.[68] Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more
					paws. They may extend their claws in hunting or self-defense, climbing, kneading, or for extra traction
					on soft surfaces. Cats shed the outside layer of their claw sheaths when scratching rough surfaces.[69]
				</p>
				<p>Most cats have five claws on their front paws and four on their rear paws. The dewclaw is proximal to the
					other claws. More proximally is a protrusion which appears to be a sixth "finger". This special feature
					of the front paws on the inside of the wrists has no function in normal walking but is thought to be an
					antiskidding device used while jumping. Some cat breeds are prone to having extra digits
					("polydactyly").[70] Polydactylous cats occur along North America's northeast coast and in Great
					Britain.[71]</p>
			</div>
			<div class="ambulation">
				<h3>Ambulation</h3>
				<p>The cat is digitigrade. It walks on the toes, with the bones of the feet making up the lower part of the
					visible leg.[72] Unlike most mammals, it uses a "pacing" gait and moves both legs on one side of the body
					before the legs on the other side. It registers directly by placing each hind paw close to the track of
					the corresponding fore paw, minimizing noise and visible tracks. This also provides sure footing for hind
					paws when navigating rough terrain. As it speeds up from walking to trotting, its gait changes to a
					"diagonal" gait: The diagonally opposite hind and fore legs move simultaneously.[73]</p>
			</div>
			<div class="balance">
				<h3>Balance</h3>
				<p class="balance-p">Most breeds of cat are noted fond of sitting in high places, or perching. A higher
					place may serve as a
					concealed site from which to hunt; domestic cats strike prey by pouncing from a perch such as a tree
					branch. Another possible explanation is that height gives the cat a better observation point, allowing it
					to survey its territory. A cat falling from heights of up to 3 meters (9.8 ft) can right itself and land
					on its paws.[74]</p>
				<p>During a fall from a high place, a cat reflexively twists its body and rights itself to land on its feet
					using its acute sense of balance and flexibility. This reflex is known as the cat righting reflex.[75] A
					cat always rights itself in the same way during a fall, if it has enough time to do so, which is the case
					in falls of 90 cm (2 ft 11 in) or more.[76] How cats are able to right themselves when falling has been
					investigated as the "falling cat problem".[77]</p>

			<div class="vision">
				<h3>Vision</h3>
				<p>Cats have excellent night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human
					vision.[64]: 43  This is partly the result of cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light
					that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim
					light.[78] Large pupils are an adaptation to dim light. The domestic cat has slit pupils, which allow it
					to focus bright light without chromatic aberration.[79] At low light, a cat's pupils expand to cover most
					of the exposed surface of its eyes.[80] The domestic cat has rather poor color vision and only two types
					of cone cells, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; its ability to distinguish between
					red and green is limited.[81] A response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rod cells
					might be due to a third type of cone. This appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than
					representing true trichromatic vision.[82]</p>
			</div>
			<div class="hearing">
				<h3 class="hearing">Hearing</h3>
				<p>The domestic cat's hearing is most acute in the range of 500 Hz to 32 kHz.[83] It can detect an extremely
					broad range of frequencies ranging from 55 Hz to 79 kHz. It can hear a range of 10.5 octaves, while
					humans and dogs can hear ranges of about 9 octaves.[84][85] Its hearing sensitivity is enhanced by its
					large movable outer ears, the pinnae, which amplify sounds and help detect the location of a noise. It
					can detect ultrasound, which enables it to detect ultrasonic calls made by rodent prey.[86][87] Recent
					research has shown that cats have socio-spatial cognitive abilities to create mental maps of owners'
					locations based on hearing owners' voices.[88]</p>
			</div>
			<div class="smell">
				<h3>Smell</h3>
				<p>Cats have an acute sense of smell, due in part to their well-developed olfactory bulb and a large surface
					of olfactory mucosa, about 5.8 square centimetres (29⁄32 square inch) in area, which is about twice that
					of humans.[89] Cats and many other animals have a Jacobson's organ in their mouths that is used in the
					behavioral process of flehmening. It allows them to sense certain aromas in a way that humans cannot.
					Cats are sensitive to pheromones such as 3-mercapto-3-methylbutan-1-ol,[90] which they use to communicate
					through urine spraying and marking with scent glands.[91] Many cats also respond strongly to plants that
					contain nepetalactone, especially catnip, as they can detect that substance at less than one part per
					billion.[92] About 70–80% of cats are affected by nepetalactone.[93] This response is also produced by
					other plants, such as silver vine (Actinidia polygama) and the herb valerian; it may be caused by the
					smell of these plants mimicking a pheromone and stimulating cats' social or sexual behaviors.[94]</p>
			</div>
			<div class="taste">
				<h3>Taste</h3>
				<p>Cats have relatively few taste buds compared to humans (470 or so versus more than 9,000 on the human
					tongue).[95] Domestic and wild cats share a taste receptor gene mutation that keeps their sweet taste
					buds from binding to sugary molecules, leaving them with no ability to taste sweetness.[citation needed]
					Their taste buds instead respond to acids, amino acids like protein, and bitter tastes.[96] Cats also
					have a distinct temperature preference for their food, preferring food with a temperature around 38 °C
					(100 °F) which is similar to that of a fresh kill and routinely rejecting food presented cold or
					refrigerated (which would signal to the cat that the "prey" item is long dead and therefore possibly
					toxic or decomposing).[95]</p>
			</div>
			<div class="whiskers">
				<h3>Whiskers</h3>
				<p>To aid with navigation and sensation, cats have dozens of movable whiskers (vibrissae) over their body,
					especially their faces. These provide information on the width of gaps and on the location of objects in
					the dark, both by touching objects directly and by sensing air currents; they also trigger protective
					blink reflexes to protect the eyes from damage.</p>
			</div>

		</div>
		<div id="behavior" class="behavior">
			<div class="title">Behavior</div>
			<div class="information">
				<p>Outdoor cats are active both day and night, although they tend to be slightly more active at night.[97]
					Domestic cats spend the majority of their time in the vicinity of their homes but can range many hundreds
					of meters from this central point. They establish territories that vary considerably in size, in one
					study ranging from 7 to 28 hectares (17–69 acres).[98] The timing of cats' activity is quite flexible and
					varied, which means house cats may be more active in the morning and evening, as a response to greater
					human activity at these times.[99]</p>
				<p>Cats conserve energy by sleeping more than most animals, especially as they grow older. The daily
					duration of sleep varies, usually between 12 and 16 hours, with 13 and 14 being the average. Some cats
					can sleep as much as 20 hours. The term "cat nap" for a short rest refers to the cat's tendency to fall
					asleep (lightly) for a brief period. While asleep, cats experience short periods of rapid eye movement
					sleep often accompanied by muscle twitches, which suggests they are dreaming.[100]</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sociability">
				<h3>Sociability</h3>
				<p class="sociability-p">The social behavior of the domestic cat ranges from widely dispersed individuals to
					feral cat colonies
					that gather around a food source, based on groups of co-operating females.[101][102] Within such groups,
					one cat is usually dominant over the others.[103] Each cat in a colony holds a distinct territory, with
					sexually active males having the largest territories, which are about 10 times larger than those of
					female cats and may overlap with several females' territories. These territories are marked by urine
					spraying, by rubbing objects at head height with secretions from facial glands, and by defecation.[91]
					Between these territories are neutral areas where cats watch and greet one another without territorial
					conflicts. Outside these neutral areas, territory holders usually chase away stranger cats, at first by
					staring, hissing, and growling and, if that does not work, by short but noisy and violent attacks.
					Despite this colonial organization, cats do not have a social survival strategy or a pack mentality, and
					always hunt alone.[104]</p>
				<p>Life in proximity to humans and other domestic animals has led to a symbiotic social adaptation in cats,
					and cats may express great affection toward humans or other animals. Ethologically, a cat's human keeper
					functions as if a mother surrogate.[105] Adult cats live their lives in a kind of extended kittenhood, a
					form of behavioral neoteny. Their high-pitched sounds may mimic the cries of a hungry human infant,
					making them particularly difficult for humans to ignore.[106] Some pet cats are poorly socialized. In
					particular, older cats show aggressiveness toward newly arrived kittens, which include biting and
					scratching; this type of behavior is known as feline asocial aggression.[107]</p>
				<p>Redirected aggression is a common form of aggression which can occur in multiple cat households. In
					redirected aggression there is usually something that agitates the cat: this could be a sight, sound, or
					another source of stimuli which causes a heightened level of anxiety or arousal. If the cat cannot attack
					the stimuli, it may direct anger elsewhere by attacking or directing aggression to the nearest cat, dog,
					human or other being.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="communicstion">
				<h3>Communication</h3>
				<p>Domestic cats use many vocalizations for communication, including purring, trilling, hissing,
					growling/snarling, grunting, and several different forms of meowing.[7] Their body language, including
					position of ears and tail, relaxation of the whole body, and kneading of the paws, are all indicators of
					mood. The tail and ears are particularly important social signal mechanisms in cats. A raised tail
					indicates a friendly greeting, and flattened ears indicates hostility. Tail-raising also indicates the
					cat's position in the group's social hierarchy, with dominant individuals raising their tails less often
					than subordinate ones.[111] Feral cats are generally silent.[112]: 208  Nose-to-nose touching is also a
					common greeting and may be followed by social grooming, which is solicited by one of the cats raising and
					tilting its head.</p>
				<p>Purring may have developed as an evolutionary advantage as a signaling mechanism of reassurance between
					mother cats and nursing kittens, who are thought to use it as a care-soliciting signal.[113] Post-nursing
					cats also often purr as a sign of contentment: when being petted, becoming relaxed,[114][115] or eating.
					Even though purring as popularly interpreted as indicative of pleasure, it has been recorded in a wide
					variety of circumstances, most of which involve physical contact between the cat and another, presumably
					trusted individual.[113] Some cats have been observed to purr continuously when chronically ill or in
					apparent pain.</p>
				<p>The exact mechanism by which cats purr has long been elusive, but it has been proposed that purring is
					generated via a series of sudden build-ups and releases of pressure as the glottis is opened and closed,
					which causes the vocal folds to separate forcefully. The laryngeal muscles in control of the glottis are
					thought to be driven by a neural oscillator which generates a cycle of contraction and release every
					30-40 milliseconds (giving a frequency of 33 to 25 Hz).</p>
